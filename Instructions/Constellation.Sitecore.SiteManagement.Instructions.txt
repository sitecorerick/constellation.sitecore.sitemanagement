============

Purpose
-------
To allow developers to quickly requisition new Sitecore sites based on existing installed information architecture.

Prep
----
1. Create the required Templates for your site in Sitecore.
2. Create the required presentation details and assign to Standard Values.
3. It is recommended to create a Branch Template that represents your "stock" site map, for use when requisitioning a site.
4. Ensure any "system" prerequisite folders are created before trying to create a site using Site Manager.
5. Create a Site Blueprint in the web config that tells Sitecore what kind of structures to create and what security they
require when requisitioning a new site. Use the provided example configuration file to get started.

Be sure to include the security settings for any created objects.

If you are using Visual Studio Build Targets (recommended), be sure to include site configuration node settings for each build target in your environment.
Site Manager will provide you with cut & paste Sitecore Site node elements as part of its build process.

6. Log into Sitecore
7. Run the SiteManager from the browser to create a site based on the blueprint.
